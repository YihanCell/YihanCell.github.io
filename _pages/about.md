Greetings! I am currently pursuing my postgraduate studies at XJTLU, diligently delving into my research in the esteemed lab led by [Xin Liu](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/departments/academy-of-pharmacy/academy-staff/academic-staff/staff/xin-liu). And I I'm honored to receive additional insightful supervision of [Yiqiang Wang](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/departments/academy-of-pharmacy/academy-staff/academic-staff/staff/yiqiang-wang). Before joining XJTLU, I graduated with a B.Ec. in Finance from Jilin University and was privileged to be recognized with the national scholarship in 2022.
