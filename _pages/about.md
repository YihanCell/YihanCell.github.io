Greetings! I am currently a short-term research assistant & pre-Ph.D. student at School of Food Science and Engineering, **South China University of Technology** (SCUT). I am privileged to be under the supervision of [Yonghua Wang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yonghua-Wang-2) and am advised by [Bo Ouyang](http://english.cemcs.cas.cn/faculty/principal/index_18794.html?json=http://cemcs.cas.cn/sourcedb_cemcs_cas/en/ywrck/pi/202008/t20200823_5670081.json) & [Charlie Xia](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0868-1923). Meanwhile I am a postgraduate student at **Xiâ€™an Jiaotong-Liverpool University** (XJTLU) in collaboration with **the University of Liverpool** (UoL), where I'm engaged in research under [Xin Liu](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/departments/academy-of-pharmacy/academy-staff/academic-staff/staff/xin-liu) and garner additional insights from [Yiqiang Wang](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/departments/academy-of-pharmacy/academy-staff/academic-staff/staff/yiqiang-wang). Prior to my postgraduate studies, I graduated with a B.Ec. from Jilin University (JLU), Zhuhai and was honored with the National Scholarship in 2022.

**Research interests:** ML/DL in enzyme engineering.
